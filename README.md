## Overview
Simon is not only a fun and challenging game but also a tool to help improve memory. This particular iteration of the 1978 classic game has four game modes. 
Each mode brings on a new set of challenges that add a modern twist to the game. There is also a random inspirational quote shown at the beginning of each game to help mentally prepare you for the challenge.

## UX

The goal of this project was to recreate Simon, the classic 1978 electronic game in a more modern software form. 

### The user
As a user ...
- I want a way to improve my memory and coordination in a fun but challenging way. 
- I would like an application that I can use on my computer but also one that is available on my mobile devices.
- I would like the application to have both visual and auditory cues.
- I would like to be able to read instruction for the game without leaving the game.
- I would like various game modes to challenge myself in fun and interesting ways.
- I would like the game to show me when I hit the wrong button.
- I would like an endless game experience that will increase in speed incrementally.
- I would like to see my score after each game as well as my best score.

### The design process

#### Scope
The goal of this project was to recreate the classic 1978 electronic game called Simon. This is a more modern aproach and is focused on delivering a clean and responsive user interface. keeping any effects subtle but still notable, without overwhelming the user with too much information at once makes for a simple but fun game. 

#### Audio
Audio plays a big part in the experience of the game and because of this, most of the audio assets used are original. All the audio files are both in mp3 and Ogg format to ensure compatibility on a wide range of devices.

#### Visual
I wanted the experience to feel like a modern game to achieve this I made use of some assets that I purchased. When it came time to create the main game buttons I used very saturated colours and added some visual effects to indicate that the button had been activated.

### Wireframes
Before starting the project I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create the following wireframes. The licence for the software was provided by Code Institute.
Here You can find my [Balsamiq project files](/Wireframes/) as well as higher resolution wireframes.

## Features

### Quotes API
At the start of the game you will be presented with an inspirational quote. 
These quotes are fetched for [this API](https://type.fit/api/quotes) found via this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/free-api-inspirational-quotes-json-with-code-examples/311373). 
Once the all the data from the API is retrieved a random quote is selected and displayed on the main game screen. After every round a new random quote will be selected and displayed. 
There are some instances where quotes would not have a author, in these cases the author is displayed as *'unknown'*.

### Game Modes
This project has four unique game modes, each one brings new challenges, this helps to keep the game both fun and challenging for a variety of users. 
The game modes are as detailed as follows:

**Classic:** 
   - When playing the game in this mode you will be presented with a set of four coloured buttons. 
   - The buttons will highlight in a sequence as well as play an auditory cue. 
   - Each step in the sequence is randomly generated. 
   - The sequence in its entirety remains the same throughout the round but gets progressively longer. 
   - After every 5th step, the sequence gets faster.
   - The player must repeat all the steps in the sequence in the original order.
   - If the player hits the incorrect coloured button a cracking sound is triggered and a cracked image overlay is displayed on the button.
   - The object to to get as long a sequence as possible, you will be presented with your best score as well as the last rounds score once the game is over.
   
**Random:**  
   - When playing the game in this mode you will be presented with a set of four coloured buttons. 
   - The buttons will highlight in a sequence as well as play an auditory cue. 
   - Each step in the sequence is randomly generated.
   - Each round sequence is then randomised before the player's turn. 
   - This random sequence gets progressively longer after each round. 
   - After every 5th step, the sequence gets faster.
   - The player must repeat all the steps in the sequence in the original order. 
   - If the player hits the incorrect coloured button a cracking sound is triggered and a cracked image overlay is displayed on the button.
   - The object to to get as long a sequence as possible, you will be presented with your best score as well as the last rounds score once the game is over.
   
**Single:**
   - When playing the game in this mode you will be presented with a set of four coloured buttons. 
   - Only the newest colour added to the sequence will highlight in a sequence as well as play an auditory cue.  
   - Each step in the sequence is randomly generated. 
   - The sequence in its entirety remains the same throughout the round but gets progressively longer. 
   - After every 5th step, the sequence gets faster.
   - The player must repeat all the steps in the sequence in the original order. 
   - If the player hits the incorrect coloured button a cracking sound is triggered and a cracked image overlay is displayed on the button.
   - The object to to get as long a sequence as possible, you will be presented with your best score as well as the last rounds score once the game is over.
   
**Reverse:**
   - When playing the game in this mode you will be presented with a set of four coloured buttons. 
   - The buttons will highlight in a sequence as well as play an auditory cue. 
   - Each step in the sequence is randomly generated. 
   - The sequence in its entirety remains the same throughout the round but gets progressively longer. 
   - After every 5th step, the sequence gets faster.
   - The player must repeat the steps in the sequence in the reverse order. 
   - If the player hits the incorrect coloured button a cracking sound is triggered and a cracked image overlay is displayed on the button.
   - The object to to get as long a sequence as possible, you will be presented with your best score as well as the last rounds score once the game is over.

### GUI Elements
With the use of graphically designed GUI elements that were both purchased and are free to use the Graphical User Interface looks neat and feels like a game.

**Favicon**
I have used [this article](https://www.w3.org/2005/10/howto-favicon) to add a favicon to my website, this just add a bit of a finishing touch to the application. The png file itself <span><img src="/assets/images/favicon" alt="Favicon Icon"></span> is an original that I created using [Adobe PhotoShop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwvOHzBRBoEiwA48i6AtbSWstaKzHCUaUKzSlnKYFxv7dELw1rAOJgZhYShhzdXSxrCp3JHxoCnG4QAvD_BwE&sdid=88X75SKR&mv=search&ef_id=CjwKCAjwvOHzBRBoEiwA48i6AtbSWstaKzHCUaUKzSlnKYFxv7dELw1rAOJgZhYShhzdXSxrCp3JHxoCnG4QAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!340669891884!e!!g!!photoshop).

**Game Buttons**
All the menu buttons and icons are from a mobile gui pack that was sourced form [Graphic Burger](https://graphicburger.com/mobile-game-gui/). In conjunction with [Adobe PhotoShop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwvOHzBRBoEiwA48i6AtbSWstaKzHCUaUKzSlnKYFxv7dELw1rAOJgZhYShhzdXSxrCp3JHxoCnG4QAvD_BwE&sdid=88X75SKR&mv=search&ef_id=CjwKCAjwvOHzBRBoEiwA48i6AtbSWstaKzHCUaUKzSlnKYFxv7dELw1rAOJgZhYShhzdXSxrCp3JHxoCnG4QAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!340669891884!e!!g!!photoshop) I 
was able to extract the elements I wanted from the source file. All images are served by the content delivery system [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to maximize the performance of the application. 

**Logo and Game Over text**
The content pack for this is something io purchased some time back, originally created by [Asa Faly Rayyan](https://www.facebook.com/asafalyrayyan) and provided in .ai format. 
With the aid of [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html?gclid=CjwKCAjw3-bzBRBhEiwAgnnLCiFDFYsUaqMcRHmDmhhvqiX-2gtK55h9ro6Pmep8P7GkxZjHNlzHsBoCvN0QAvD_BwE&sdid=88X75SKR&mv=search&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3-bzBRBhEiwAgnnLCiFDFYsUaqMcRHmDmhhvqiX-2gtK55h9ro6Pmep8P7GkxZjHNlzHsBoCvN0QAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!340693010824!e!!g!!adobe%20illistrator) I was able to create both the game title text and the game over text. 
As with the button images these are also served by the content delivery system [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

<!-- testing -->

## Testing

```
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<!-- Deployment -->

## Deployment

```
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
