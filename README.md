## Overview
Simon is not only a fun and challenging game but also a tool to help improve memory. 

This particular iteration of the 1978 classic game has four game modes. Each mode brings on a new set of challenges that add a modern twist to the game. 

There is also a random inspirational quote shown at the beginning of each game to help mentally prepare you for the challenge.

## UX

The goal of this project was to recreate the classic 1978 

###The user
As a user I want a way to improve my memory and coordination in a fun but challenging way. I would like an application that I can use on my computer but also one that is available on my mobile devices.The application should have both visual and auditory cues and have various game modes to keep it fresh. 

###The design process

####Scope
The goal of this project was to recreate the classic 1978 electronic game called Simon. I made this a more modern version and focused on delivering a clean user interface. I kept the effects subtle but still notable, without overwhelming the user with too much information at once. 

####Audio
Audio plays a big part in the experience of the game and because of this, I decided to make some of it myself. I was also very particular in choosing the best sounds for the job. 

####Visual
I wanted the experience to feel like a modern game to achieve this I made use of some assets that I purchased. When it came time to create the main game buttons I used very saturated colours and added some visual effects to indicate that the button had been activated.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. 
That you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself.
(in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### Wireframes

These are my wireframes I created during the design process, they were great as a guide to get started. Here you can also find the original [Balsamiq Mockup](/Wireframes/) file.

<!-- features -->

## Features
This project has some great features form different game modes to themes. All of these features combined make for a great overall experience.

###Game Modes

**Classic**
When playing the game in this mode you will be presented with a set of four coloured buttons. The buttons will light up in a sequence, each step in the sequence is randomly generated. The entire sequence remains the same throughout the round but it gets progressively longer. After every 5th step, the sequence gets faster. If the player hits the incorrect coloured button the button plays a cracking sound and shows a cracked image overlay. 

**Random** 
This mode behaves similarly to the Classic mode with the added twist of randomizing the sequence every round. This makes it more challenging as the player is unable to memorize the sequence as a whole and is forced to rely on short bursts of memory. 

**Last-Only**
With this mode you are getting the same type of sequence you would get with the Classic mode with the added challenge of only seeing the last step in the sequence. The player must then replicate the entire sequence relying heavily on their memory of the sequence.

**Reverse**
The sequence is created and presented in the same way as the Classic mode. This time, however, the player must play back the sequence in reverse. This makes for some interesting gameplay.

```
 In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

<!-- technologies used -->

## Technologies Used
```
I used the following technologies to create this website:

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to *construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its *official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

 [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
   - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


1. HTML
2. CSS
3. [Bootstrap (4.4.0)](https://getbootstrap.com/)
4. [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
5. [Font Awesome (5.11.2)](https://fontawesome.com/)
6. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
7. [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)

### Tools for the job

Below is a list of tools I used to create this website.

- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - This is the IDE I used to start building the website.
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) - A free image editor I used to create and edit come of the site content.
- [Balsamq](https://balsamiq.com/) - All my wireframes were created in the desktop version of Balsamiq.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Used this editor for building parts of the website.
- [Git Hub](https://github.com/) - Used this site to manage my projects storage as well as host the website.
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) Used to double-check all my spelling and grammar.
- [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) - used this to check my HTML for errors and typos.
- [W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - used this to check my CSS for errors.
- [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - I used this tool to make sure I did not miss any prefixing in my code.

<!-- testing -->

## Testing

```
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<!-- Deployment -->

## Deployment

```
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
